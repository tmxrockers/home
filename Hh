Write a Poem celebrating the essence of Tamil New Year / Tamil Nādu / Tamil Language

In the land of Tamil Nadu,
Where the language is so grand,
There's a day that's celebrated,
With joy and pride in every hand.

The Tamil New Year has arrived,
And we welcome it with glee,
For it marks a time of new beginnings,
And a chance to start anew, you see.

We light the lamps and draw kolams,
And dress up in our best attire,
To honour the traditions of our culture,
And celebrate with fervour and fire.

The taste of sweet pongal fills the air,
And we savour every bite,
As we gather with family and friends,
To revel in this joyful night.

The Tamil language is our pride,
Our heritage and our soul,
It's a language of beauty and depth,
That helps us stay connected and whole.

So let us raise our voices high,
And celebrate this special day,
For Tamil New Year brings us hope,
And lights our path in every way.

In Tamil like vairamuthu

As the sun rises on Tamil Nadu,
A new year dawns with a fresh hue,
A language that flows like a river,
A culture that's rich and forever.

With Puthandu comes a new dawn,
A time to celebrate and move on,
We light lamps, draw kolams and pray,
For happiness, peace and love every day.

The taste of sweet Pongal fills the air,
As we savour every morsel with care,
It's a time to bond with family and friends,
And cherish the love that never ends.

Tamil, the language of the heart,
Is a work of art that sets us apart,
It's a language that sings and dances,
A beautiful blend of emotions and nuances.

From Sangam poetry to modern prose,
Tamil's words like a river flows,
It's a language that weaves stories,
Of love, war, peace and glories.

As we celebrate Tamil Nadu's essence,
Let's cherish the language's quintessence,
For it's the soul of our culture and history,
A language that's a work of poetry.
