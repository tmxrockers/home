Detailed Approach
1. Analytical Application Design
•	User Input:
o	The user will select the masking workflow type (e.g., SP Workflow, ITCL Workflow) through an interactive interface in Alteryx.
o	Additional inputs, such as environment type (PROD/TEST), can also be added.
•	Dynamic Workflow Configuration:
o	Based on the selected workflow type, the application will fetch predefined files and corresponding masking rules dynamically.
•	Metadata-Driven Masking Logic:
o	Masking rules will be stored in a metadata repository (Excel or a database).
o	Metadata will include:
	Workflow type.
	File name and format.
	Columns to be masked.
	Masking patterns (e.g., Constant, Prefix, Suffix, Null, Email).
	Header row positions.
2. Key Components
•	Metadata Storage:
o	Centralized storage in an Excel file or a database (e.g., SQLite, SQL Server).
o	Example structure:

CopyEdit
| Workflow Type | File Name   | Column Name  | Masking Pattern | Masking Rule     | Header Row | Notes          |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|
| SP Workflow   | file1.xlsx  | Name         | Constant        | ***MASKED***     | 1          | Full Masking   |
| SP Workflow   | file2.xlsx  | Email        | Email           | user****@email.com | 2        | Partial Masking|
| ITCL Workflow | file3.csv   | Phone Number | Prefix          | MASKED-######### | 1          | Prefix Masking |
•	Masking Logic:
o	Apply transformations based on metadata:
	Replace sensitive data with:
	Constant Values: Replace all content with predefined values (e.g., "MASKED").
	Prefix/Suffix: Append or prepend masking characters (e.g., "MASKED-####").
	Null: Replace data with null or blank values.
	Email Masking: Obfuscate email addresses, e.g., user****@domain.com.
	Retain original file format, structure, and non-sensitive data.
•	Output Management:
o	Save the masked files in a predefined destination directory, maintaining folder structure for easy traceability.

Workflow Steps
1.	Input Collection:
o	User selects:
	Masking workflow type (e.g., SP Workflow, ITCL Workflow).
	Environment type (PROD/TEST).
2.	Metadata Lookup:
o	The workflow reads the metadata repository to fetch:
	Files to be processed.
	Masking rules (columns, patterns, masking type, and header positions).
3.	File Reading:
o	Use the Directory Tool in Alteryx to locate files dynamically based on the selected workflow and metadata.
o	Example: If SP Workflow is selected, files from /prod/source/SP/ are read.
4.	Data Masking:
o	Apply masking logic using the Formula Tool or a custom Python script within Alteryx:
	Replace sensitive data in specified columns.
	Transform data as per metadata-defined patterns.
5.	Save Masked Output:
o	Save masked files in the destination directory: /prod/masked/<workflow_type>/.
6.	Logging and Validation:
o	Log processed files and outcomes for auditing purposes.

Benefits
1.	Scalability:
o	Easily adaptable to new workflows, files, or masking rules by updating metadata.
2.	Consistency:
o	Centralized metadata ensures uniform masking across all workflows.
3.	Efficiency:
o	Automates file handling and transformation, reducing manual intervention.
4.	Flexibility:
o	Metadata-driven approach allows for quick updates without workflow redesign.
5.	Auditability:
o	Logging mechanisms provide traceability for processed files and applied masking.
