Slide 2: Impact on GRM Release 16 Plan

Timeline Adjustments

Original Release Date: May 17, 2025

Updated Release Date: June 7, 2025

Reason for Delay: Additional development sprint due to Alteryx upgrade


Development Sprints

Previously: 4 Development Sprints

Now: 5 Development Sprints (Added one more sprint after the Alteryx upgrade)


Impact Analysis

No Impact on SIT and UAT Phases

SIT starts on April 23, 2025

UAT starts on May 7, 2025

Alteryx upgrade completes by April 18, 2025 → No direct impact on testing phases

Slide 3: Proposal Plan for GRM Release 16

Key Considerations

✅ Aligning development with Alteryx upgrade completion
✅ Ensuring SIT and UAT phases remain unaffected
✅ Maintaining stability in the GRM release while incorporating necessary changes

Proposed Actions

1. Finalizing SIT Readiness before April 23, 2025


2. Enhancing Regression Testing post-Alteryx upgrade to ensure compatibility


3. Monitoring UAT closely (May 7 – May 20, 2025) for any unexpected issues


4. Code Freeze on May 30, 2025, leading to final deployment on June 7, 2025

Slide 4: Production SS Upgrade – Impact on GDR & Fieldglass Reports

Upgrade Window: May 12 – May 19, 2025

During this period, GRM application will be partially available

GDR downstream Fieldglass reports will be affected, leading to outdated data in:

SP Incremental

ITCL Incremental

ITCL Open Positions

Work Order Pipeline

TCS Health Logic

Finance Forecast & Drill Down

PMMT Reports



Mitigation Strategy

✅ Pre-extract critical reports before May 12
✅ Communicate to downstream teams about temporary unavailability
✅ Post-upgrade data validation before UAT starts on May 7
