Subject: Re: SQL Execution in PRE-PROD Environment

Hi [Recipient's Name],

Thank you for your clarification regarding the "ignore" feature in Datical. I appreciate your insights on its intended use, but I’m concerned that it may not fully address our current needs.

To improve our efficiency and reduce the time spent on repetitive manual execution, I believe it would be beneficial to explore the possibility of utilizing separate branches for each environment. This approach could help us manage environment-specific changes more effectively and minimize the risk of errors. However, I’m not entirely familiar with how the branching strategy would work within Datical, and I would love to hear your thoughts on that.

I genuinely think that adopting this strategy could significantly streamline our workflows and allow our team to focus on more important tasks. I would greatly appreciate your insights and any other suggestions you might have for enhancing our process.

Thank you for considering this!

Best regards,  
Arun
