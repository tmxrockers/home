3. SP Headcount - Monthly:

For the SP Headcount - Monthly report, the business story entails refining the data to comply with audit and policy regulations. This involves modifying the monthly headcount generation process to exclude VISA-related fields, ensuring that the generated report only contains sanitized information.

4. SP Headcount - Weekly:

Similar to the monthly headcount report, the SP Headcount - Weekly user story involves adjusting the weekly headcount generation process. The goal is to remove any VISA-related fields during data processing, guaranteeing that the weekly report adheres to audit and policy requirements.

5. SP Universal Set - VU Point:

In the SP Universal Set - VU Point, the business story focuses on maintaining data integrity and compliance. This entails modifying the VU Point generation process to exclude VISA-related fields, ensuring that the VU Point dataset aligns with audit and policy guidelines.

These business stories collectively contribute to the data cleanup initiative across different workflows, promoting compliance and adherence to audit and policy standards in the GRM project.
