Hereâ€™s a refined version of your input that you could use in a feedback form or survey:

---

**1. Improve Internal Communication Tools:**
We need a better communication platform (like Microsoft Teams or a similar tool) that allows direct group messaging. This would make it easier to coordinate activities such as employee engagement events or team outings. Currently, emails are often ignored or overlooked, making it difficult for organizers to gather responses or plan effectively.

**2. Streamline Event Coordination:**
Providing access to group-based communication or polling tools would significantly improve participation and coordination for events like team dinners or engagement activities. It would reduce the burden on the organizer and increase employee responsiveness.

Let me know if you'd like to tailor this for a specific tone (e.g., formal, friendly, concise).
