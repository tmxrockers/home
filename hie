Acceptance Criteria:
âœ… Metadata should be dynamically fetched from the configured repository (Excel or Database).
âœ… The workflow should correctly apply masking based on metadata definitions.
âœ… Users should be able to update metadata without modifying the workflow.
âœ… Masked output should be validated against the metadata rules.

6) Data Masking - Cycle Time - Field Glass Workflow Integration & Unit Testing the Workflow

Story Description:
Develop and test the data masking workflow for Cycle Time - Field Glass data. Ensure consistency in field transformations and process efficiency.

Acceptance Criteria:
âœ… Cycle Time data should be processed without structural changes.
âœ… Masking should follow metadata-driven logic with validation checks.
âœ… Unit tests should verify accuracy and compliance of masked data.
âœ… Workflow execution should be logged for traceability.


---

7) Data Masking - TCSHL - Workflow Integration & Unit Testing the Workflow

Story Description:
Integrate and validate data masking for TCSHL datasets within the Alteryx workflow. Ensure efficient handling of structured and semi-structured data formats.

Acceptance Criteria:
âœ… TCSHL data should be masked as per predefined rules.
âœ… Workflow should handle different data structures dynamically.
âœ… Masked data should be verified through automated tests.
âœ… Logging mechanism should capture processed records and any anomalies.


---

8) Data Masking - Work Order Pipeline - Field Glass Workflow Integration & Unit Testing the Workflow

Story Description:
Develop and validate an Alteryx workflow for masking sensitive data in the Work Order Pipeline - Field Glass dataset while maintaining data usability.

Acceptance Criteria:
âœ… Work Order Pipeline data should be masked according to metadata rules.
âœ… Masking should not alter essential business data structures.
âœ… Unit testing should validate all masked fields for consistency.
âœ… Processed data should be logged for audit purposes.


---

9) Enabler - Data Masking - Alteryx ETL Workflow Design - WMP Dataset

Story Description:
Design an Alteryx ETL workflow for WMP Dataset masking, ensuring compatibility with existing metadata-driven logic.

Acceptance Criteria:
âœ… WMP dataset structure should be analyzed and incorporated into metadata.
âœ… Workflow should support flexible masking configurations.
âœ… Design should align with broader data masking automation strategy.
âœ… Documentation should be created for future development reference.

10) Data Masking - Implement Alteryx ETL Workflow - Fetching/Masking the WMP Tables Data in Share Drive

Story Description:
Develop an Alteryx workflow to fetch WMP tables data from the Share Drive, apply masking logic, and store the masked data securely.

Acceptance Criteria:
âœ… Workflow should successfully fetch WMP data from Share Drive.
âœ… Masking logic should be applied dynamically based on metadata.
âœ… Masked files should be saved in a designated output location.
âœ… Logs should track processed records and any issues encountered.


---

11) Data Masking - Implement Alteryx ETL Workflow - Read the WMP Tables Data from Share Drive & Move to Environment Specific

Story Description:
Extend the data masking workflow to read WMP tables data from the Share Drive and move it to environment-specific locations after processing.

Acceptance Criteria:
âœ… Workflow should read WMP tables from the predefined Share Drive path.
âœ… Masked data should be moved to the correct environment folder (PROD/TEST).
