Root Cause Document for Lag and Delay in Bulk Edit Page with Multiple Mat Form-Fields

Issue Summary:
Users are experiencing lag and delay in the bulk edit page of a mat table when the component contains multiple mat form-fields. The delay is causing a poor user experience and decreased productivity.

Root Cause Analysis:

After analyzing the issue, the root cause appears to be related to the performance of the application. The following factors may be contributing to the lag and delay in the bulk edit page with multiple mat form-fields:

Rendering: The mat form-fields are rendered dynamically as the user interacts with the page. The more fields there are, the longer it takes to render the page. This can result in a lag or delay in the user interface.

Data Processing: When the user inputs data into the mat form-fields, the application processes this data and updates the mat table accordingly. With multiple fields, there is a larger amount of data being processed which can cause the application to slow down.

Network Latency: Depending on the size of the data being processed and the network speed, there may be a delay in the response time between the user input and the application's response. This can lead to a lag or delay in the user interface.

Code Efficiency: The code responsible for rendering the bulk edit page may not be optimized for performance, leading to slower processing times and a lag or delay in the user interface.

Solution Recommendations:

To address the root cause of the lag and delay issue, the following solutions can be implemented:

Optimize Rendering: The rendering of the mat form-fields can be optimized by implementing techniques such as lazy loading and virtual scrolling. This can improve the performance of the page and reduce the lag or delay experienced by the user.

Data Processing: The application can be optimized to process data more efficiently. This can be achieved by implementing algorithms that can handle larger amounts of data more efficiently. Additionally, caching can be implemented to reduce the amount of data processing required.

Network Latency: The application can be optimized to reduce network latency. This can be achieved by implementing techniques such as caching, compression, and server-side rendering.

Code Efficiency: The code responsible for rendering the bulk edit page can be optimized to improve performance. This can be achieved by implementing best practices such as minimizing the use of loops, reducing the number of DOM elements, and optimizing event listeners.

Conclusion:

The lag and delay in the bulk edit page with multiple mat form-fields in the mat table is caused by a combination of factors, including rendering, data processing, network latency, and code efficiency. To address this issue, the application can be optimized by implementing solutions such as lazy loading, virtual scrolling, caching, compression, and code optimization. By addressing these root causes, the application can improve performance and provide a better user experience.




Root Cause Document:

Issue: Lag and delay occurs when the component is having more number of mat form-fields in the bulk edit page in the mat table.

Description: The user experiences lag and delay while trying to bulk edit a page with more number of mat form-fields in the mat table.

Root Cause:

Rendering: The more number of mat form-fields in the bulk edit page is causing rendering issues. When the component is rendering with a large number of mat form-fields, the browser is struggling to render the UI, which causes lag and delay.

Data Binding: The data binding in the component is causing a delay. When there are multiple form-fields in the bulk edit page, the data binding process takes more time to complete, which slows down the component.

Code Optimization: The component code is not optimized for large datasets. As the number of form-fields increases in the bulk edit page, the component's code is not optimized to handle the large dataset, which causes the lag and delay.

Performance Issues: The performance of the browser is causing the lag and delay. When the browser is handling a large number of form-fields in the bulk edit page, it can cause performance issues, which can slow down the component.

Solution:

Rendering: The component should be optimized for rendering with a large number of form-fields. This can be achieved by using lazy loading, virtual scrolling, and by minimizing the DOM manipulation.

Data Binding: The data binding process should be optimized. This can be achieved by using one-way data binding, trackBy function, and by avoiding two-way data binding.

Code Optimization: The component's code should be optimized for large datasets. This can be achieved by using memoization, code splitting, and by avoiding unnecessary operations.

Performance: The browser's performance should be improved. This can be achieved by using performance optimization techniques like debouncing, throttling, and by using web workers.

Conclusion:

The lag and delay in the component can be attributed to rendering, data binding, code optimization, and performance issues. The solution to this issue involves optimizing the rendering, data binding, code, and browser performance.
