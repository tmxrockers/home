Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the **approach, features, benefits, limitations, and effort estimation** for each technology:

---

### **1. Java with Angular**
#### **Approach:**
This approach uses Angular for the frontend and Java (e.g., Spring Boot) for the backend to implement data masking workflows. The user interacts with a rich UI built in Angular, while backend APIs handle the masking logic and file processing.

#### **Features:**
- **Custom Masking Rules:** Ability to create and manage complex masking rules tailored to different data types.
- **Secure API Integration:** Ensures secure data processing and communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Database Support:** Stores metadata, logs, and masking rules.
- **File Format Preservation:** Maintains the original style and formatting of input files.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for large-scale datasets and concurrent processing.

#### **Benefits:**
- **Customizability:** Highly flexible for creating advanced masking rules and workflows.
- **Scalability:** Can handle large datasets and support enterprise-grade requirements.
- **Rich UI:** Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for non-technical users.
- **Integration-friendly:** Can connect with other systems (e.g., SharePoint, cloud storage).

#### **Limitations:**
- **Development Time:** Requires significant effort to build from scratch.
- **Expertise Required:** Needs skilled developers for Angular and Java.
- **Resource Intensive:** May require higher computational resources for large-scale applications.

#### **Effort Estimation:**
- **Story Points:** 29
- **Estimated Effort:** 18 Days
  - Frontend Development: 8 Days
  - Backend Development: 7 Days
  - Testing and Deployment: 3 Days

### **2. Jenkins Pipeline with Python Scripts**
#### **Approach:**
This approach involves creating a Jenkins pipeline that integrates Python scripts for dynamic file masking. Users can trigger workflows via Jenkins, selecting environment and workflow parameters through dropdown options.

#### **Features:**
- **Automated Workflows:** Runs end-to-end data masking workflows triggered by Jenkins builds.
- **Dynamic Inputs:** Allows users to input file locations, masking rules, and environment configurations during build execution.
- **Integration:** Compatible with SharePoint, local directories, and remote file systems.
- **Logging:** Generates logs for tracking progress and errors.

#### **Benefits:**
- **Automation:** Fully automates the masking process, reducing manual intervention.
- **Reusability:** Python scripts can be reused across different pipelines and projects.
- **Flexibility:** Supports multiple environments and workflows with minimal configuration changes.

#### **Limitations:**
- **Format Preservation:** May require additional effort to preserve file styles and formatting.
- **Dependency on Jenkins:** Requires Jenkins for execution, limiting portability.
- **Complex Configuration:** Requires careful pipeline design for complex workflows.

#### **Effort Estimation:**
- **Story Points:** 26
- **Estimated Effort:** 16 Days
  - Python Script Development: 7 Days
  - Jenkins Pipeline Setup: 6 Days
  - Testing and Deployment: 3 Days

### **3. Excel Macros**
#### **Approach:**
This approach leverages VBA macros within Excel to perform data masking. Users can execute predefined macros to mask sensitive data in Excel files.

#### **Features:**
- **Predefined Logic:** Implements masking logic for specific columns or cells in Excel files.
- **Simple Execution:** Users can trigger macros with a single click.
- **No External Dependencies:** Works entirely within Excel without additional tools.

#### **Benefits:**
- **Ease of Use:** Requires minimal technical knowledge to execute macros.
- **Quick Setup:** Easy to implement for small datasets or simple use cases.
- **Low Cost:** No need for additional software or licenses.

#### **Limitations:**
- **Scalability:** Not suitable for large datasets or complex workflows.
- **Limited Customization:** Restricted to the capabilities of VBA and Excel.
- **Format Loss:** Formatting of the file may be altered depending on the macro logic.

#### **Effort Estimation:**
- **Story Points:** 19
- **Estimated Effort:** 12 Days
  - Macro Development: 7 Days
  - Testing and Debugging: 3 Days
  - Deployment and Training: 2 Days

### **4. Alteryx Workflow**
#### **Approach:**
Uses Alteryx Designer to create drag-and-drop workflows for data masking. Alteryx tools are configured to handle input files, apply masking rules, and save output.

#### **Features:**
- **Drag-and-Drop Design:** Simplifies workflow creation with visual tools.
- **Prebuilt Tools:** Offers ready-to-use tools for data manipulation and masking.
- **Multiple Data Sources:** Supports integration with Excel, databases, and other file formats.

#### **Benefits:**
- **Ease of Use:** Non-technical users can create workflows with minimal training.
- **Speed:** Faster development and execution for simple workflows.
- **Versatility:** Supports a wide range of input and output formats.

#### **Limitations:**
- **File Formatting Issues:** Does not preserve original file styles and content perfectly.
- **Customization:** Limited flexibility for advanced masking rules.
- **Licensing Costs:** Requires an Alteryx Designer license, which can be expensive.

#### **Effort Estimation:**
- **Story Points:** 22
- **Estimated Effort:** 14 Days
  - Workflow Development: 9 Days
  - Testing and Debugging: 3 Days
  - Deployment and Training: 2 Days
