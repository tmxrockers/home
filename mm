Data Masking - Analysis Document

1. Java with Angular

Approach:

Backend: Use Spring Boot (Java) to handle data masking logic, processing, and API management.

Frontend: Develop a rich user interface in Angular to allow users to:

Upload files for masking.

Select masking rules dynamically.

Download the masked files.



Features:

1. Custom Masking Rules: Allow users to define their masking logic dynamically (e.g., replace patterns, mask columns).


2. Secure API Integration: Use REST APIs to handle file uploads, masking logic, and result downloads.


3. Database Integration: Optionally store masking configurations and logs in a database (MySQL/Oracle).


4. Scalability: Can handle large datasets efficiently with multi-threaded Java processing.


5. Error Reporting: Notify users of masking errors in the UI.



Benefits:

Highly customizable and scalable.

Rich UI with Angular for ease of use.

Can integrate with other tools (e.g., logging frameworks, monitoring tools).

Secure and robust processing.


Limitations:

Higher initial development and maintenance effort.

Requires deployment infrastructure (e.g., cloud or on-premise servers).

2. Jenkins Pipeline for Python Script Integration

Approach:

Build a Jenkins Pipeline to trigger Python scripts for data masking.

Integrate SharePoint or local directory access for input/output files.

Provide Jenkins pipeline parameters for:

Workflow selection (e.g., Python script).

Environment selection (e.g., DEV, QA, PROD).

Input file path.


Use Python scripts for the actual masking logic.


Features:

1. Automated Workflows: Automates data masking tasks through Jenkins pipelines.


2. Dynamic Inputs: Users can select masking workflows, environments, and files dynamically.


3. Integration with File Repositories: Supports SharePoint or local file systems for input/output files.


4. Extensible: Easy to add new workflows (scripts) as needed.



Benefits:

Lightweight and easy to implement.

Automated and repeatable process.

Can leverage Pythonâ€™s flexibility and libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy) for masking.

Centralized control via Jenkins.


Limitations:

Requires Jenkins setup and management.

Dependency on Python scripts for customization.

Limited UI capabilities compared to full-stack solutions.

3. Excel Macros

Approach:

Use Excel VBA Macros to perform data masking.

Users upload the data directly into an Excel workbook.

VBA scripts process the data and mask sensitive columns.

Masked data is saved as a new Excel file.


Features:

1. Simple Interface: Users can interact directly through Excel.


2. Predefined Masking Rules: Implement hardcoded masking logic in VBA scripts.


3. One-Click Execution: Users can trigger macros with a button click.


4. No Additional Software: Everything runs inside Excel.



Benefits:

Very easy to implement and use.

No additional setup or server requirements.

Ideal for small datasets or one-time masking tasks.


Limitations:

Not suitable for large datasets (performance issues with VBA).

Hard to scale or integrate with other tools.

Limited customizability and error handling.

Recommendations

For Scalable Enterprise Solutions: Use Java with Angular.

For Automation and CI/CD Integration: Use Jenkins with Python Scripts.

For Quick and Simple Tasks: Use Excel Macros.
