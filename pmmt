We recently encountered an issue with the PMMT daily report subscription. The PO had missed renewing the subscription, resulting in old data being processed for approximately one week.

To address this and prevent recurrence, we have worked out three corrective approaches:

Plan 1 – Redeployment Process Documentation
We have prepared a detailed process document for complete redeployment. This ensures that all jobs, including PMMT, are validated to run successfully with the latest data.

Plan 2 – Access for Production Support Team
We are planning to extend PMMT subscription access to the Production Support team. This will allow them to directly manage and renew the subscription, reducing dependency on a single role.

Plan 3 – Blocker Validation in PMMT ETL Workflow
We have implemented a new validation layer within the PMMT ETL workflow. This will automatically check whether the stage table has been refreshed with the latest PMMT data before further processing.

If the validation fails, the workflow will be stopped.

An automated failure notification will be triggered via email, prompting the user to log into GRM and review the validation message.


The PMMT workflow now includes the following blocker validations:

1. Data type validation – Ensures all numeric and date fields are valid.


2. Mandatory field validation – Ensures Resource ID and Year fields are not null.


3. Duplicate data validation – Detects duplicate Resource ID and Year combinations.


4. Data refresh validation (newly added) – Ensures the stage table is refreshed daily; otherwise, the workflow halts and raises an alert.



These corrective measures strengthen our process by adding redundancy, governance, and automated controls to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Please let me know if you would like us to proceed with all three approaches or prioritize any of them.
