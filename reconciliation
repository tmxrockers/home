This table outlines the criteria for updating the "Has VISA" field post-reconciliation. It includes conditions based on the country, VISA dependency, and a special consideration for requests not originating from WMP/GRM. The "Has VISA" field is determined as "TBD" for countries other than the USA, set to "Yes" for VISA Dependent cases in the USA, and "No" for VISA Independent cases in the USA. Additionally, requests not from WMP/GRM involve comparing data with Old Headcount/One-time Master files until January based on the Person ID field.
