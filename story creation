ChatGPT
1. SP Incremental Workflow ETL:

As a user, I want to implement a data cleanup process in the SP Incremental Workflow ETL to remove all VISA-related fields from the database, ensuring compliance with audit and policy requirements. This will involve modifying the ETL workflow to exclude and cleanse these fields during data extraction, transformation, and loading.

2. SP Universal Set - Governance Summary:

In the SP Universal Set - Governance Summary, the user story involves enhancing the data governance by excluding VISA fields. The task is to update the summary generation process, ensuring it doesn't include any VISA-related information. This ensures that the governance summary reflects accurate and policy-compliant data.

3. SP Headcount - Monthly:

For the SP Headcount - Monthly report, the business story entails refining the data to comply with audit and policy regulations. This involves modifying the monthly headcount generation process to exclude VISA-related fields, ensuring that the generated report only contains sanitized information.

4. SP Headcount - Weekly:

Similar to the monthly headcount report, the SP Headcount - Weekly user story involves adjusting the weekly headcount generation process. The goal is to remove any VISA-related fields during data processing, guaranteeing that the weekly report adheres to audit and policy requirements.

5. SP Universal Set - VU Point:

In the SP Universal Set - VU Point, the business story focuses on maintaining data integrity and compliance. This entails modifying the VU Point generation process to exclude VISA-related fields, ensuring that the VU Point dataset aligns with audit and policy guidelines.

These business stories collectively contribute to the data cleanup initiative across different workflows, promoting compliance and adherence to audit and policy standards in the GRM project.
