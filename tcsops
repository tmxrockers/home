To create a PowerPoint (PPT) presentation for this technical design document, you should focus on simplifying and visually organizing the information into clear sections. Here is a suggested structure for the PPT:

### Slide 1: Title Slide
- **Title**: TCS Staffing Register Health Logic ETL Workflow
- **Subtitle**: Technical Design Overview
- **Your Name/Team Name**
- **Date**

### Slide 2: Introduction
- **Objective**: Overview of the ETL workflows in place for TCS Staffing Register Health Logic.
- **Key Points**:
  - Introduction to the TCS Staffing Register HLSC and SP Incremental ETL workflows.
  - Explanation of the purpose of the "SP Universal Set" table.

### Slide 3: Current Workflow Overview
- **TCS Staffing Register HLSC Workflow**:
  - Description: Monthly upload of manually generated files.
  - **Destination**: SP Universal Set table.

- **SP Incremental Workflow**:
  - Description: System-generated files.
  - **Destination**: SP Universal Set table.

### Slide 4: Problem Statement
- **Issue Identified**:
  - **GDCE ID Matching Problem**: Manual records not matching the staffing register reference table will not be processed.
  - **Inconsistent Records**: Some GDCE IDs are off-boarded and cause inconsistencies when moved between workflows.

### Slide 5: Proposed Solution
- **Reference Table Utilization**:
  - Explanation: Reference table to identify and filter out unmatched GDCE ID records.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. **Check Records Against Reference Table**: Before persisting data, verify GDCE ID records.
  2. **Delete Duplicate Records**: Clear all TCS Ops records from the SP Universal Set table before updating.

### Slide 6: Workflow Diagram (Optional)
- **Visual Representation**: A flowchart or diagram illustrating the ETL process from source file upload to data persistence in the SP Universal Set table.

### Slide 7: Data Flow (Detailed)
- **File Upload**:
  - Description of monthly manual uploads for TCS Staffing Register HLSC.
  - Data processing steps in the ETL workflow.
  
- **GDCE ID Validation**:
  - Explanation of how records are matched against the reference table.
  
- **Persistence Logic**:
  - Details on deleting existing records and updating with new records.

### Slide 8: Conclusion
- **Summary**:
  - Reinforce the importance of the reference table for maintaining data consistency.
  - Highlight the solution's impact on preventing duplicate and inconsistent records.

### Slide 9: Questions & Next Steps
- **Questions**: Open the floor for any questions.
- **Next Steps**: Outline any remaining tasks or steps for implementation.

To create a 2-page PowerPoint presentation that covers the key points of the technical design document, I suggest the following structure:

---

### **Slide 1: Overview of ETL Workflows & Problem Statement**

#### **Title**: TCS Staffing Register Health Logic ETL Workflow

**1. ETL Workflows Overview**  
   - **TCS Staffing Register HLSC Workflow**:  
     - Manual file upload on a monthly basis.
     - Data is persisted into the "SP Universal Set" table.

   - **SP Incremental Workflow**:  
     - System-generated file upload.
     - Data is also persisted into the "SP Universal Set" table.

**2. Problem Statement**  
   - **GDCE ID Matching Issue**:  
     - Records from TCS Staffing Register HLSC may not match the reference table.
     - Unmatched records are not processed by the ETL workflow.
   - **Inconsistencies in GDCE IDs**:  
     - Some off-boarded records in "SP Incremental" cause data inconsistencies.

---

### **Slide 2: Proposed Solution & Workflow Logic**

**1. Solution Overview**  
   - **Reference Table Check**:  
     - Use a reference table to match GDCE IDs before processing.
   - **Duplicate Record Prevention**:  
     - Delete existing TCS Ops records from the "SP Universal Set" table before updating it with new data.

**2. Data Flow Process**  
   - **Step 1**: Upload the TCS Staffing Register HLSC file.
   - **Step 2**: Validate records against the reference table.
   - **Step 3**: Delete existing TCS Ops records from "SP Universal Set".
   - **Step 4**: Persist the new validated records.

This concise format gives a clear and focused summary of the technical design document in just two slides. You can add visuals like simple flow diagrams or bullet points for clarity.







Here is a one-pager brief documentation for the TCS Staffing Register Health Logic ETL workflow:

### **TCS Staffing Register Health Logic ETL Workflow - Brief Documentation**

#### **Overview:**
The TCS Staffing Register Health Logic ETL workflow involves two key workflows that persist data into a common destination table called the "SP Universal Set."

1. **TCS Staffing Register HLSC Workflow**:
   - **Input**: Monthly manual file upload.
   - **Process**: Data from the file is processed and persisted in the "SP Universal Set" table.

2. **SP Incremental Workflow**:
   - **Input**: System-generated file.
   - **Process**: Data from the system-generated file is also persisted in the "SP Universal Set" table.

#### **Problem Statement:**
- **GDCE ID Matching Issue**:  
  Records from the TCS Staffing Register HLSC file may not match the reference table. If a record is not found in the reference table, it will not be processed, leading to inconsistencies.
- **Inconsistent Data**:  
  Some GDCE IDs that are off-boarded in the SP Incremental workflow cause inconsistencies when moved between workflows.

#### **Proposed Solution:**
- **Reference Table Check**:  
  Before persisting records, the ETL workflow should validate GDCE IDs against a reference table. Records that do not match will be excluded from processing.
  
- **Duplicate Record Prevention**:  
  Prior to updating the "SP Universal Set" table, all TCS Ops records should be deleted from the table to prevent duplication.

#### **Workflow Process:**
1. **File Upload**: Manually upload the TCS Staffing Register HLSC file.
2. **Validation**: Match GDCE ID records against the reference table.
3. **Delete Existing Records**: Remove all TCS Ops records from the "SP Universal Set" table.
4. **Persist New Records**: Insert the validated records into the table.
