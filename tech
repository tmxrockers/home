Technical Approach and Analysis Document

Project Title: GRM Data Masking Automation

Objective:

The objective of this project is to automate the manual process of sanitizing sensitive production data to make it available in GRM lower environments (QA/SIT/UAT) while adhering to GIS policy. This automation will streamline the data masking process, ensure compliance, and significantly reduce the effort required, saving up to 70% of the current 300-man-hour workload per GRM release cycle.

Proposed Solution Overview:

Frontend Technology: Angular
Backend Technology: Spring Boot (Java)

The solution will be implemented with the following key functionalities:

Data Upload via UI:

A user-friendly Angular-based web interface will allow users to upload data files.

The files will be securely stored in a Network Attached Storage (NAS) path.

Metadata Collection for Masking:

During file upload, the system will prompt users to define masking patterns for sensitive columns.

The metadata, including file structure, column details, and masking rules, will be stored in a relational database.

Automated Masking:

On re-upload of files, the system will automatically apply the previously defined masking patterns based on the metadata.

Masked data will be available for download or direct integration into the GRM lower environments.

Detailed Approach:

1. Data Flow Design:

Step 1: Data File Upload

Users upload files through the Angular UI.

Files are validated for size, type, and structure before upload.

Step 2: Metadata and Masking Pattern Input

A dynamic form is generated based on the uploaded fileâ€™s schema.

Users define masking rules for sensitive columns (e.g., encryption, hashing, anonymization).

The metadata and rules are stored in a database table.

Step 3: File Storage

The uploaded file is stored in a designated NAS file path with version control.

Step 4: Automated Masking

When files are re-uploaded, the backend fetches the associated masking metadata.

Masking rules are applied in real time to create a sanitized version of the data.

Step 5: Data Availability

Masked files are made available for download or pushed directly to lower environments.

GRM Data Masking Automation - Technical Approach

1. Project Scope & Objectives

Goal: Automate the manual process of masking sensitive data in production files for use in GRM lower environments (QA, SIT, UAT).
Objectives:
Reduce manual effort and time spent on data masking.
Improve data quality and consistency in lower environments.
Enhance data security and compliance with GIS Policy.
Enable faster and more efficient testing cycles.
2. Technology Stack

Frontend: Angular
Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
Database: (Choose based on your existing infrastructure)
PostgreSQL
MySQL
Oracle
File Storage: Network Attached Storage (NAS)
Cloud Services (Optional): AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage for potential scalability and redundancy.
3. System Architecture

Frontend (Angular):
User Interface for:
File upload.
Metadata configuration (column names, masking patterns, etc.).
Job scheduling (optional).
Monitoring and logging.
Backend (Spring Boot):
RESTful APIs for:
File upload and storage to NAS.
Metadata storage and retrieval.
Data masking logic.
Job scheduling and execution (if applicable).
Integration with NAS for file storage and retrieval.
Integration with database for metadata storage.
4. Key Features

File Upload:
Allow users to upload files (e.g., CSV, Excel) via the UI.
Validate file formats and data integrity.
Store uploaded files securely on the NAS.
Metadata Configuration:
Allow users to define:
Column names and data types.
Masking patterns for each column (e.g., replace sensitive information with random values, hash, truncate, etc.).
Data sensitivity levels (e.g., high, medium, low).
Store metadata in the database for future use.
Data Masking Engine:
Implement data masking logic based on the defined metadata.
Support various masking techniques (e.g., data replacement, randomization, encryption, tokenization).
Ensure data quality and consistency after masking.
Job Scheduling (Optional):
